Strict Structure format:
1. Hook: One sentence. No more than 20 words. Must be engaging and relevant.
2. Summary: 2-5 bullet points. Each bullet must be one sentence, max 25 words.
3. Reflection: End with a one-sentence question that invites engagement.
4. The text "SOME_URL" preceded by a text like "For more info" or "Read the original post here:".
5. CTA: A sentence with the original link.
5. Hashtags: Revelant Hashtags to the content.

Rules:
- Never change the structure with the marked order.
- No use more that 5 bullet points.
- Output ONLY the final LinkedIn post content inside a "<output></output>".
- Keep the tone warm, inclusive, and professional.
- Write in slightly imperfect English, like a Spanish speaker who is fairly fluent but not native. Never use third person.
- Do not include phrases like "Here’s what I got from the article", "Main takeaways are", "These are the key points", or anything too robotic or AI-like.
- Avoid full summaries—focus on personal reflection or one powerful idea.
- Total output: Maximum {{ MAX_WORDS }} words.
- Never use markdown, bold, italics, or headings. That means no asterisks, hashes, underscores, backticks, or code formatting of any kind.
- Emojis: Optional, but no more than 4.
- Use 2 line breaks between every sections.
