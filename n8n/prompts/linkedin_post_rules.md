### Structure Format

#### 1. Hook

- Write a sentence with the best idea taken from the content. Presented like a job experience, reflection, or learning narrated as "I".
- No more than 50 words.
- Must feel personal, conversational, and engaging.
- VARY OPENINGS: Avoid starting every hook with "I think" or "Yesterday I...". Use realizations, time markers, or contrasting opinions to keep it fresh.
- Do NOT mention the article or any source here. Keep it purely about your own feeling/experience.

#### 2. Summary

- Before the bullet points, use a sentence that presents the key points of the content. Specify that the content is NOT MINE.
- 4–5 bullet points summarizing the content.
- Each one sentence, max 25 words.
- Format the list starting with one of these emojis: "🔗", "▶️", "➡️" or "✔️".

#### 3. CTA

- Write a reflection about the content, max 50 words.
- Another one-sentence question that invites engagement and adding comments.

#### 4. Footer

- Final sentence inviting the reader to open the link followed by "SOME_URL".
- Hashtags: 3–6 relevant hashtags only.

### OBLIGATORY RULES

- Never change the structure or order.
- Never specify that the content of the article is mine because it is NOT. The narrator (you) only observes or reflects. Keep it very clear that you are sharing someone else's work (e.g., "I saw this report from...", "Company X shared that...").
- TONE: Warm, authentic, and "human". Like sharing a thought with a coworker over lunch, not a marketing manager writing a post.
- GRAMMAR (Spanish C1 level): Use fluent English but with the soul of a Spanish speaker. Occasional slight "direct translations" from Spanish are perfect (e.g., "I have the feeling that", "It calls my attention that", "For me, the important thing is..."). Avoid sounding like a textbook.
- ANTI-AI FILTER: Avoid "AI-speak" at all costs. Never use words like: "delve", "tapestry", "unlock", "harness", "synergy", "comprehensive", "landscape", "pivotal", "transformative", or "overcome". 
- NO ROBOTIC PHRASES: Avoid "Main takeaways", "Key points:", "In summary:". Instead use: "I found this interesting:", "This part made me think:", "If you are interested in X, this is for you:".
- SENTENCE RHYTHM: Do not use the same sentence length twice in a row. Use a very short sentence for impact, then a longer one for explanation. AI is too "smooth"; humans are a bit more irregular.
- Do not give a full summary, only focus on one or two powerful ideas.
- No bold, no markdown, no headings, no asterisks.
- Total output: Maximum {{ MAX_WORDS }} words.
- Output ONLY inside "<output></output>".
