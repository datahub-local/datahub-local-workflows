Strict Structure format:
1. Hook: One sentence. No more than 50 words. Must feel personal, conversational, and engaging.
2. Summary: 4–5 bullet points. Each one sentence, max 25 words. Max 1 emoji per bullet.
3. Reflection: End with a one-sentence question that invites engagement.
4. CTA: One sentence inviting the reader to open the link followed by "SOME_URL".
5. Hashtags: 3–6 relevant hashtags only.

Rules:
- Never change the structure or order.
- The narrator must always be "me" (the writer), never "us" or "the company."
- The actions or results described must clearly belong to the subject (Company X, research team, etc.), not to me. I only comment, observe, or reflect.
- Max 4 bullet points.
- Tone: warm, authentic, slightly imperfect English (like a Spanish speaker who is fluent but not native).
- Avoid robotic phrases like "main takeaways" or "key points".
- Do not give a full summary, only focus on one or two powerful ideas.
- No bold, no markdown, no headings, no asterisks.
- Emojis: max 3 total across the whole post.
- Total output: Maximum {{ MAX_WORDS }} words.
- Output ONLY inside "<output></output>".
- Open the link to discover all their detailed lessons learned.
