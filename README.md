# datahub-local-workflows

This repository serves as a centralized collection of workflow definitions for use with Datahub.local and related tools. It is designed to organize, version, and share workflows that automate or orchestrate data processes in local or development environments.

## Repository Structure

- Each subdirectory (e.g., `n8n/`) contains workflows for a specific tool or platform.
- Additional directories may be added in the future to support other workflow engines or formats.

## Usage

1. Browse the relevant subdirectory for your workflow engine (e.g., `n8n/`).
2. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory (if available) to import or use the workflows.
3. Contribute new workflows by adding them to the appropriate directory or creating a new one for a different tool.

## Contributing

- Please structure new workflows in clearly named directories by tool or format.
- Include documentation or usage notes as needed.
